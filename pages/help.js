Here is a brief list of functionalities that will help you with exploring and understanding the contents of this application.

<h3 className={styles.h3}>Interpreting the map:</h3>

In the beginning you get introduced to a map visualising a distribution of all species for each country. The more intense a colour of a country is, the higher the amount of species at risk it contains. 

<h3 className={styles.h3}>Filters:</h3>

It is possible to change the species shown by using the filter function found on the right hand side, making it possible to filter among species based on their IUCNâ€™s red 
list categories, threats that species are exposed to and four different kingdoms. 

<h3 className={styles.h3}>Hover:</h3>
By hovering over a country you get a glimpse of the total number of species based on the chosen filters. 

<h3 className={styles.h3}>Details on demand:</h3>

If you wish to further explore the species within a country, clicking on a country will navigate you to a more detailed view, containing a stacked bar chart as well as filter options. The stacked bar chart has the amount of species on the y-axis, threats (one per bar, 12 in total) on the x-axis. The sub-bars within a bar represent the red list categories. Hovering over a sub-bar allows you to see the exact number of species for that sub-bar.

<h3 className={styles.h3}>Navigation:</h3>Basic navigation through the map is done by pan and zoom.
